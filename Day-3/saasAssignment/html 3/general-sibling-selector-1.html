    <h4>Styling Goal: Apply a distinct background color, a larger font size, and a left border to only those paragraphs (< p >) that immediately follow an < h1 > element.</h4>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is the first paragraph of the introduction.</p>
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is nested inside a div, so it's not a direct sibling of H1.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is the second paragraph of the introduction, coming after the div.</p>
    <h2>Another Section</h2>
    <p>This paragraph follows an H2, so it should NOT be styled by the rule.</p>
    <p>And another paragraph here.</p>
